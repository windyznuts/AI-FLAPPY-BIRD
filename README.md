# AI-FLAPPY-BIRD
 
**AI FLAPPY BIRD: a classic game, coded with python using pygame library (a famous python library that facilitate creating games) ,  modified to work on auto mode with AI. it uses an interesting algorithm  called "neuroevolution of augmenting topologies" (NEAT). It is a type of genetic algorithm used for evolving artificial neural networks. by starting with a population of neural networks with very simple structures. The networks are then evaluated based on their performance on a given task, so it choses the best path for the birds ingame in order to survive.
